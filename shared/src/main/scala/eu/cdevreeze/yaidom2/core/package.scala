package eu.cdevreeze.yaidom2

/**
 * The core concepts of yaidom2. For example, qualified names, expanded names, namespace declarations and in-scope namespaces.
 * These concepts form a "namespace theory", in which they are related to each other in a mathematically precise way.
 *
 * The rest of yaidom2 depends on this package, and reversely, this package depends on nothing else in yaidom2.
