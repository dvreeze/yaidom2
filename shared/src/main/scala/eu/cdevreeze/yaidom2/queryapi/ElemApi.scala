 * Element API. It knows how to find elements by following one of the axes descendant-or-self, descendant
 * or child. It does not know anything about XML, so this API could even be used for non-XML tree-like objects.
 *
 * Concrete element implementations that (in)directly implement this interface should have efficient implementations
 * of the methods offered by this API. These methods can in turn be used to implement element step factories.
