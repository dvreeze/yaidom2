/**
 * This package contains an element creation DSL, offering the ScopedNodes.Elem query API. The DSL is as friendly
 * to create as resolved elements, but it retains a Scope. The ease of use comes at the price that this Scope must be
 * invertible and contain no default namespace. Also, all elements must have the same Scope, or, at least each descendant
 * element must have at least the same Scope or a super-set.
