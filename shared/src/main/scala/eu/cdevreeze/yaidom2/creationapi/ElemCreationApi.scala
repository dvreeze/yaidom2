/**
 * Element creation API. Typical implementations are rather stable objects that use a NamespacePrefixMapper internally.
 *
 * To turn namespaces into prefixes, and therefore ENames into QNames, the parent PrefixedScope (if any) is first consulted,
 * falling back to a NamespacePrefixMapper, if one is used.
 *
 * It is not a type class, although it is easy to turn it into an imaginary type class with a type parameter for the element type.
 *
 * Implementation note: this trait used a ListMap for the attributes instead of VectorMap (via the SeqMap API), due to Scala issue
 * https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/8854.
